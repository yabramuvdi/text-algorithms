# text-algorithms-benchmarking
Python implementation of multiple text as data methods and benchmarking on publicly available datasets. Below a brief description of the data and the main methods demonstrated.

## Data

### Economic Policy Uncertainty

- Labeled articles available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/47gly3j56qcyd9z0oxajc/AADj_gjG6K9zwVr07uO-rKU?rlkey=be9ebhggjtknaxhrzwrpqiinc&dl=0)

## Methods

## 1. Dicitonary methods

For gigantic corpora and interesting alternative to the implementation from this repository is [flashtext](https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext)

## 2. Logistic regression on a bag-of-words

## 3. Small language models (i.e. BERT and friends)

## 4. Large language models

Zero-shot and no finetuning. 

## 5. Finetune open-source large language models

Llama 3
