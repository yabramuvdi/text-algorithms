# text-algorithms
Python implementation of multiple text as data methods and benchmarking on publicly available datasets. Below a brief description of the main methods demonstrated.


## 1. Dicitonary methods

For gigantic corpora and interesting alternative to the implementation from this repository is [flashtext](https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext)

## 2. Logistic regression on a bag-of-words

## 3. Small language models (i.e. BERT and friends)

## 4. Large language models

Zero-shot and no finetuning. 

## 5. Finetune open-source large language models
